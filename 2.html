<h2>AURA</h2>
<p>An <strong><u><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2395" target="_blank" title="aura medical definition"> aura</a></u></strong> or <strong><u>human energy field</u></strong> is, according to New Age beliefs, a colored emanation said to enclose a human body or any animal or object.
  In some esoteric positions, the aura is described as a subtle body.
  Psychics and holistic medicine practitioners often claim to have the ability to see the size, color and type of vibration of an aura.</p>

<p style ="margin-top:40px;">In New Age alternative medicine, the human aura is seen as a hidden anatomy that affect the health of a client, and is often understood to comprise centers of vital force called chakra.
  Such claims are not supported by scientific evidence and are pseudoscience.
  When tested under controlled experiments, the ability to see auras has not been shown to exist.</p>
