<h2>Postdrome</h2>
<p>The migraine <strong><u><a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/understanding-migraine/how-to-deal-with-postdrome/" target="_blank" title="Postdrome medical definition">postdrome</a></u></strong> could be defined as that constellation of symptoms occurring once the acute headache has settled.
   Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed. The person may feel tired or "hung over" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.
   According to one summary, "Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and malaise."
   For some individuals this can vary each time.</p>

   <p style="margin-top:20px;"> Just as it can be difficult to determine what triggers migraine attacks in individual people, there’s no singular known cause behind postdrome. Postdrome is actually part of the migraine attack itself. The profound changes in activity and blood flow that occur during the aura and head pain phase of the attack, persists even after the pain has ended. Not every migraine will be followed by a postdrome phase, and the severity of the migraine doesn’t always correspond to the intensity of the postdrome that follows.</p>
